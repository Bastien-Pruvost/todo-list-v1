## About the project

A simple todo list to practice javascript.  
The features are: Add tasks, Modify them, Delete them, and set them to 'finished' status.  
I also used webpack for this project to start practicing on it.  
  
I plan to make a second much more complete version that will come in the future. That's why it's called 'v1'.
